Soon Unix had the mass of Andre the Giant, the body of the Elephant Man, and the
mind of a forgotten Jack Nicholson character.

The worst strain was on Unix's mind.  Unable to assimilate all the conflicting
patchworks of features it had ingested, its personality began to fragment into
millions of distinct, incompatible operating systems.  People would cautiously say
"good morning Unix.  And who are we today?" and it would reply "Beastie" (BSD), or
"Domain", or "I'm System III, but I'll be System V tomorrow." Psychiatrists
labored for years to weld together the two major poles of Unix's personality,
"Beasty Boy", an inner-city youth from Berkeley, and "Belle", a southern
transvestite who wanted a to be a woman.  With each attempt, the two poles would
mutate, like psychotic retroviruses, leaving their union a worthless blob of
protoplasm requiring constant life support to remain compatible with its parent
personalities.
Finally, unbalanced by its own cancerous growth, Unix fell into a vat of toxic
radioactive wombat urine, from which it emerged, skin white and hair green.  It
smelled like somebody's dead grandmother.

“aestheticles: n.  The little-known source of aesthetic reactions.  If your whole
body feels like going into a fetal position or otherwise double over from the pain
of experiencing something exceptionally ugly and inelegant, such as C++, it’s
because your aestheticles got creamed.” -- Erik Naggum

The thing you have to remember about "hacker news" is that nothing posted there is
news and none of the people who frequent it are hackers.  "Web Developer with an
Unwarranted Sense of Self-Importance" just doesn't roll off the tongue quite as
readily as "hacker," just like "link-dump and self promotion" doesn't have the
same ring as "news." -- Kurt H. Maier
