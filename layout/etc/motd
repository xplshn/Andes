Welcome to Andes!
Andes is a set of customizations applied on top of Alpine Linux to make it more appealing to Unix nerds.
Andes grows with each passing day, contributions are welcome! We are currently hosted at <https://github.com/xplshn/andes>

The Alpine Wiki contains a large amount of how-to guides and general
information about administrating Alpine-based systems.
See <https://wiki.alpinelinux.org/>.

You can setup the system with the command: setup-alpine
